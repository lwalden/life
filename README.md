Conways Game of Life in Javascript

This was originally a weekend project I did for my portfolio when I was in Code boot camp over a decade ago.

To test Claude, v2.0.0 was written using Claude Code and the following prompt.

Agent: claude-opus-4-5-20251101 in VS Code using Claude Code Extention with all skills on.

Prompt:

I've loaded up an old github project from when I was learning coding. This is a static webpage that generates a version of Conway's Game of Life in a browser. I want to re-create this project using only HTML, CSS, and modern javascript. It should still run as a static page. It should have no dependencies on any third party scripts. Can you create a plan of action, show it to me for review then implement it?

Otherwise I only approved its choices. Not bad Claude.
